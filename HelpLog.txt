Some Advices:
I hope that this course can give me more specific explaniation or introduction for something.
Such as knowledge about Matcap or procedural palettes.
At least, I hope I can get some links to these pages, which can give me a more clear idea of the whole thing.
I totally understand that the PPT cannot include so much staffs. So, I hope this course can at least give
these information in the form of reading material. In this way, it can save me lots of time in searching for
a reliable article in introducing these knowledge.
